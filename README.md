# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Greenhouse Gas Emissions is the final project at UT, Austin's Data Analysis and Visualization bootcamp.

## Overview
The project studies country specific factors that can influence carbon dioxide emissions world wide and uses Machine Learning to predict emissions from growth indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population, and energy usage. The following questions are addressed:
- Which countries have the largest CO2 gas emissions?
- Can a machine learning algorithm predict emissions based on a country's growth indicators?
- How does CO2 emissions change year over year?
- What is the strongest country indicator that can influence carbondioxide emissions?
- How does GDP influence CO2 emissions?
- How does population influence CO2 emissions?
- USA Data:
  - Which state and city has the most CO2 emissions?
  - What sector generates the most CO2 emissions?
  - What cities contribute to the CO2 emissions' sectors?
